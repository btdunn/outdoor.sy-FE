# outdoor.sy FrontEnd

outdoor.sy allows users to upload CSV or DSV files via a simple drag and drop interface, and then displays the data in an easy to use/read table. The table can be sorted by any of the table values in ascending or descending order by clicking the headings!

## Technology

React, React Table, React papa-parse

## Use/Installation

1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm start (use port 3001, or any port besides 3000)

## Potential imporvements
- Implimenting TypeScript, especially if this app were to scale up in complexity and scope.
- Improved styling, likely using MUI or a comparable library.
- Search functionality, and/or table pagination/page skip functionality (all things i've implimented in the past).
- Error handling.
- Testing, perhaps with Cypress.
